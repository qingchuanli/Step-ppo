# PaperScout: An Autonomous Agent for Academic Paper Search with Process-Aware Sequence-Level Policy Optimization

> 🔍 PaperScout is an autonomous LLM-based agent that reformulates academic paper search as a **multi-turn decision-making process**, dynamically deciding *when* and *how* to invoke search and citation expansion tools.
> 
> 🧠 To train such agents effectively, we introduce **PSPO (Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization)**, a process-aware, sequence-level RL algorithm tailored for agentic retrieval.

📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10029](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10029).

## 🚀 From Static Retrieval to Agentic Search

Academic paper search is a core step in scientific research, but existing systems suffer from non-negligible limitations.

> **Semantic Match:**
> Treats paper search as a single-shot retrieval problem, assuming relevance can be determined from the query alone.
> 
> **Fixed Workflow:**
> Decomposes search into multiple steps, but follows a predefined pipeline that cannot adapt to evolving search results.

PaperScout addresses these challenges by **treating paper search as a sequential decision-making problem**, enabling flexible, context-aware automatic paper discovery.

## 🧠 PaperScout Framework

PaperScout models academic paper search as a **POMDP**, where the agent iteratively interacts with an external retrieval environment.

### Core Components

* **State.**
  A latent *paper pool* containing all retrieved papers so far.

* **Observation.**
  A summarized view of the pool, including:

  * top-ranked expanded papers,
  * candidate papers for further expansion,
  * interaction history to avoid redundancy.

* **Actions.**

  * `Search(query)`: retrieve new papers from scholarly search engines
  * `Expand(paper)`: follow citation links of an existing paper

* **Reward.**
  Designed to maximize **expected recall of relevant papers**, while penalizing redundant actions.

## ⚙️ Training Challenge: Why PSPO?

Training multi-turn retrieval agents with standard RL methods is surprisingly hard:

* **Token-level PPO**
  ❌ Misaligned with agent turns → noisy credit assignment
* **Outcome-only methods (e.g., GRPO)**
  ❌ Too coarse → ignore intermediate process signals

### ✨ Our Solution: PSPO

We propose **Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO)**, which aligns optimization *exactly* with the agent’s interaction granularity.

**Key properties of PSPO:**

* Treats each *complete agent response* as an atomic action
* Performs **sequence-level advantage estimation**
* Incorporates **process rewards** via a learned critic
* Significantly improves **training stability and sample efficiency**

## 📊 Experimental Results

PaperScout is evaluated on both **synthetic** and **real-world** academic search benchmarks.

### Main Results

* Consistently outperforms:

  * Google Search / Google Scholar
  * Workflow-driven agents (PaSa, SPAR)
* Achieves **higher recall with fewer tool calls**
* A **4B model trained with PSPO** matches or surpasses a much larger untrained backbone

## 🔎 Case Study: Adaptive Multi-Turn Retrieval

PaperScout dynamically alternates between *Search* and *Expand* as retrieval progresses.

**Observation:**
When citation expansion becomes saturated, the agent *re-initiates search* to explore new directions—behavior that fixed workflows cannot express.
